# Pokemon Unite Build Tracker using ASP.NET Core Web App (MVC)

I have been playing [Pokémon Unite](https://unite.pokemon.com/en-ca/manga/) for several years, a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) where players control Pokémon with unique abilities and compete to score points. Each Pokémon can equip a pre-set build of three held items before matches, which enhances their stats and performance in various ways. To optimize my gameplay, I often referred to external resources like UniteDB for build suggestions. Inspired by this, I decided to create my own build tracker as a mockup using ASP.NET Core MVC.
